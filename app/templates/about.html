            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of Crypter is to provide simple, anonymous, and secure file transfer to the public.
                Crypter does not collect your personal information or device information.  Users are not tracked whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice this website has "https" in the URL.  That means file are uploaded to the Crypter server through a secure connection.
                As soon as the server receives your file, it encrypts the file using a randomly generated key.  This key gets returned to the user when the upload is completed.
                The encrypted file remains on the server for up to 24 hours or until someone downloads the file with the correct decryption key.
                Keys are NOT saved on the server.  Encrypted files cannot be decrypted without the key.
            </p>
            <p>
                To download a file you must provide the file "ID" and a decryption key.
                Expect an error message if the file does not exist or the decryption key could not decrypt the file.
            </p>
